### Deep Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network  
This repository has executable .ipynb files in which I have built Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network from scratch using NumPy and pandas. 
I have also built the same architectures of DNN and CNN in Tensorflow.
